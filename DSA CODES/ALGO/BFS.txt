open = list of generated but unexplored nodes
Closed= list of explored nodes

ALGO--

LOOP until open is empty or success is returned
(N,P)<-- remove head(open)and add it to close

if N is the goal node return success and construct path from initail state to goal state

else generate successors of node N and add it to the end of the open that are not already generated

OPEN <-- OPEN U {MOVEGEN(N) \{OPEN U CLOSED}}( to end)
