LOOP until open is empty or success is returned
(N,P)<-- remove head(open)and add it to close
if N is the goal node reuturn success and construct path from root node goal node

else genrate successors of node n and added to the front of the open which are not explored

open <-- open U {MOVEGEN(N)}\{OPEN U CLOSED} to the end
