open = list of generated but unexplored nodes
Closed= list of explored nodes

ALGO--

loop until open is empty or success is generated
(N,P)<-- remove head (open) and add it to close
if N is the goal node, return success generate the path from initial state to goal 
else generate successors of node N and add it open only those who are not explored 

OPEN <-- OPEN U {MOVEGEN(N)}\{OPEN U CLOSED}
end if
