Open= initially generated bur explored nodes
Closed=all the explored nodes

ALGO--

LOOP until open is empty or success is returned
(N,P)<-- remove head(open) and add it to Close

if N is the goal Node, return success and construct the path from initial node to N.

else generate successors of node N and add it to open

(OPEN)<--OPEN U {MOVEGEN(N)}
